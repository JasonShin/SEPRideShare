            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>We designed ShareTheRide to solve the problem of inefficient travel in the Sydney area.
                We wanted to give people the opportunity to use resources that already exist.
                There are 4 million people in Sydney.</p>
            <p>Lots of them are routinely driving back and forth to and from the same locations.
                We've created a system which enables Sydney to pool its resources together so that
                we can save eachother's time by Sharing The Ride.</p>
